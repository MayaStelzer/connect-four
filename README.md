# CPSC 224 Final Project: Connect 4

### Project Description:

Connect Four is a two-player strategy game. The objective of the game is to be the first player to connect four of their token in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, on the game grid. The grid usually consists of six rows and seven columns, forming 42 total slots for discs to be placed. Each player has a set of 21 tokens they can use. To play, each player gets their own color token and they take turns selecting a column to drop their token. The token is then placed at the lowest available position in that column. The first player to connect four discs in a row in any direction wins the game. If the grid fills up without a winner, the game is considered a draw.
